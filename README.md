## Hi there 👋 I am Jurga

♻️ On transformation to a trustworthy Data Analyst.

🎓 Masters' Degree in Environmental Management. 

👑 A mature Family Operations Manager with 18 years of experience managing complex family operations across Germany, France, Lithuania, and the Netherlands. With a team of four (plus 1), I excel in data collection, analysis, and strategic decision-making in a dynamic environment.

💪 As my current job does not provide enough challenges anymore, I am devoting myself to become a trustworthy Data Analyst.

🔒 I am committed to continuous learning and am excited to see how the world of Data Analytics is changing and evolving. I am curious to find out where this journey will take me.

🫶 I care about sustainability and protecting nature! I love long hiking trips.

🤝 If you are looking for help on your project (especially if it's connected to sustainability), feel free to connect! I would be happy to help!
