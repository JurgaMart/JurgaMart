## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Jurga

A mature Family Operations Manager with 18 years of experience managing complex family operations across Germany, France, Lithuania, and the Netherlands. With a team of four (plus 1), I excel in data collection, analysis, and strategic decision-making in a dynamic environment.

As my current job does not provide enough challenges anymore, I am currently on track to add more technical skills to my profile and become a Data Analyst. So far, I have covered:
- âœ… SQL
- âœ… Tableau
- âœ… Excel
- âœ… Python
- âœ… Data Storytelling

I am committed to continuous learning and am excited to see how the world of Data Analytics is changing and evolving. I am curious to find out where this journey will take me.

I also care about sustainability and protecting nature! I love long hiking trips (last time I went, I walked for 5 days in a forest in Sweden without meeting another human being!).

If you are looking for help on your project connected to sustainability, feel free to connect! I would be happy to help!
